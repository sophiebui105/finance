Optimal Portfolio Design: Risk and Return Analysis
This project explores the relationship between risk and return in finance and applies these principles to design an optimal portfolio. It uses real-world stock data from the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to calculate key financial metrics and construct a diversified investment portfolio.

Project Overview
The project involves:

Stock Selection: Ten stocks from diverse industries on the ASX were chosen to represent different market sectors.
Data Retrieval: Monthly price data from 2018 to 2024 were collected from Yahoo Finance, focusing on Adjusted Closing Prices.
Risk and Return Calculation:
Average Return: Measures stock performance over time.
Standard Deviation: Quantifies the volatility (risk) of stock prices.
Graphical Analysis: Scatter plots visualize the risk-return trade-off for informed decision-making.
Beta Estimation: Beta values were calculated for each stock using regression analysis to evaluate their market sensitivity.
Portfolio Optimization: Applied optimization techniques to construct a portfolio balancing risk and return.
Stock Selection
The selected stocks represent key sectors:

Energy: AGL Energy Limited (AGL)
Healthcare: Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited (FPH)
Finance: Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)
IT: NextDC Limited (NXT)
Communication: Telstra Corporation Limited (TLS)
Real Estate: Dexus (DXS)
Transportation: Qantas Airways Limited (QAN)
Consumer Goods: Woolworths Group Limited (WOW)
Mining: Fortescue Metals Group Limited (FMG)
This diverse selection ensures a robust representation of the market, facilitating better analysis of risk-return dynamics.

Data Processing
Data Sources
Monthly stock prices (Adjusted Closing Prices) were retrieved from Yahoo Finance.
Benchmark and risk-free rates were incorporated for beta calculations.
Tools and Methods
Excel: For returns and variance calculations.
R and Regression Analysis: To estimate beta values and optimize the portfolio.
Scatter Plots: To visualize the risk-return trade-off.
Key Outputs
Risk-Return Analysis
A scatter plot illustrates the trade-off between risk (standard deviation) and return (average).
High-risk, high-return stocks (e.g., AGL) contrast with low-risk, low-return stocks (e.g., DXS, WOW).
Portfolio Construction
Optimal portfolio weights were calculated using covariance matrices and constrained optimization methods.
Diversification principles were applied to minimize risk while targeting reasonable returns.
